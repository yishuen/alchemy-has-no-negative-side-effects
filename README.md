# Alchemy Has No Negative Side Effects
in this project, we explore the characteristics of cannabis strains!

#### Our Two APIs
* StrainAPI - strains, flavors, effects
* Otreeba - strains, lineages

### Why Did We Choose This?
Because - why not? Marijuana should no longer be a taboo subject. It's 2018. With 20% of the country having marijuana fully legal and 32 states (plus DC!) having medical marijuana, the need for medical marijuana research is booming!

"Given Colorado has 1.7% of the nation's population and based on its tax revenue from marijuana, the entire country could potentially generate $14 billion if it was legalized nationwide!!" - Andrew

$14 BILLION IN A YEAR! That is too much to overlook.

Plus, getting high is fun.

### Our Project
We decided to explore the race, flavors, effects of marijuana strains based on their lineage. We pulled this data from two APIs. 1970 strains from StrainAPI and OVER 9000 strains from Otreeba. There happened to be an overlap of 772 strains that had full data.

Using Dash, Plotly, Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc., we put together some really informational charts for your consumption.

We also looked at the top 25 strains of marijuana in 2018 to see what people like in their weed!

Fun fact: the strain named **Alchemy**, aptly has zero negative side effects.
