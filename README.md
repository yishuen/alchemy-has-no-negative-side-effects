# Alchemy Has No Negative Side Effects
In this data visualization project, we explore the characteristics of cannabis strains.

Project partner: [Adam Liscia](https://github.com/AdamLiscia) 

#### Our Two APIs
* StrainAPI - strains, flavors, effects
* Otreeba - strains, lineages

### Our Project
We decided to explore the race, flavors, effects of marijuana strains based on their lineage. We pulled this data from two APIs. 1970 strains from StrainAPI and OVER 9000 strains from Otreeba. There happened to be an overlap of 772 strains that had full data.

Using Dash, Plotly and Flask for the front end and SQLAlchemy for creating the ORM, we put together a dashboard to visualize the data
